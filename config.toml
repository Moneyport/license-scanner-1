# License Scanner Config - CI Version
# use this config for running license_scanner as part of a CI workflow

[environment]

title = "License Scanner Config"

##
# What mode should we run the scanner in?
# options:
# - "standalone": will run the tool against all repos listed in the `repos` list (below)
# - "ci": will run the tool against the repo defined in `pathToRepo`
mode = 'ci'

##
# How we should process the licenses
# options are: 
# - "fossa-api": will export to fossa api (requires FOSSA_API_KEY to be set in .env)
# - "fossa-json": will export from fossa to a folder of json files. This just shows import heirarchies, and doesn't scan licenses
# - "lc-csv": will use npm license-checker, and export to a list of csv files
# - "lc-summary": will use npm license-checker, and export a summary file for each repo
tool = "lc-csv"

# The path to the repo that will be scanned
# Ignored when `mode = "standalone"`
